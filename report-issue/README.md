# Report issue

Web dialog and macro/ui extension on Navigator. show many degrees of customization and branding
of a commonly requested feature.

Flow:
After a call ends (min 5 minutes), or when the user pressed Feedback:

Hi, how would you rate the experience of using this room?
1 Awesome
2 Ok
3 Not great

If 1: fireworks - hope to see you again soon
If 3: What was not satisfactory?

1. Audio/video (send logs)
2. The room itself
3. Other

Ok: Feel free to add a comment on the problem as well.
You name/email? (Optional)

Then, post the feedback on webex space, and to surveynow (most important)
Provide the name of the room too, as well as metrics from the call

For web dialog, provide a couple of different brandings (Disney logo!)
